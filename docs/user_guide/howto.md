# Howto

This section gathers Fink's common questions and commands.

## How to get Fink?

Fink is not yet distributed via standard channels such as pip or conda. we plan on doing it soon, but for the moment you need to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astrolabsoftware/fink-broker.git
cd fink-broker
```

Then install the required python dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, define `FINK_HOME` and add the path to the Fink binaries and modules in your `.bash_profile`:

```bash
# in ~/.bash_profile
export FINK_HOME=/path/to/fink-broker
export PYTHONPATH=$FINK_HOME/python:$PYTHONPATH
export PATH=$FINK_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

## Dashboard

### How to start the dashboard

The dashboard starts with

```bash
fink start dashboard
```

and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### How to change the port for the dashboard?

In the configuration `conf/fink.conf`, change the line:

```bash
FINK_UI_PORT=5000
```

### How to redirect ports to access the dashboard from a cluster?

You might need to redirect the port to get access to the dashboard:

```
# Assuming the port for the dashboard will be FINK_UI_PORT
ssh -L $FINK_UI_PORT:clustername:$FINK_UI_PORT username@clustername
# connection...
fink start dashboard
# Follow the URL (local redirection)
```

## Services

### How do I test the broker?

Just execute the test suite:

```
fink_test
```

You should see plenty of verbose logs from Apache Spark at screen (and yet we have shut most of them!), and finally the coverage.

### How do I start a service?

You can start a service by its name (assuming it is available):

```bash
fink start <service>
```

If you want to know which services are available:

```bash
fink
Monitor Kafka stream received by Apache Spark

 Usage:
 	to start: fink start <service> [-h] [-c <conf>] [--simulator]
 	to stop : fink stop <service> [-h] [-c <conf>]

 To get this help:
 	fink

 To get help for a service:
 	fink start <service> -h

 Available services are: dashboard, archive, monitor, classify
 Typical configuration would be ${FINK_HOME}/conf/fink.conf
```

### How do I stop a service?

If you launch the service using

```bash
fink start <service>
```

just exit it using CTRL+C. If you put the service in the background, like

```bash
fink start <service> > service.log &
```

You can exit it using:

```bash
fink stop <service>
```

Note that currently this command will stop all services running (not just your service)... This will change soon.

### How do I put my service in the background while keeping the log?

Just redirect the output and escape:

```bash
fink start <service> > service.log &
```

### How do I get help on a service?

You easily get help on a service using:

```bash
fink start <service_name> -h
```

This will also tells you which configuration parameters can be used, e.g.

```shell
fink start monitor -h
usage: monitor_fromstream.py [-h] [-servers SERVERS] [-topic TOPIC]
                             [-schema SCHEMA]
                             [-startingoffsets STARTINGOFFSETS]
                             [-outputpath OUTPUTPATH]
                             [-checkpointpath CHECKPOINTPATH]
                             [-finkwebpath FINKWEBPATH] [-tinterval TINTERVAL]
                             [-tinterval_kafka TINTERVAL_KAFKA]
                             [-exit_after EXIT_AFTER] [-datapath DATAPATH]
                             [-poolsize POOLSIZE]

Monitor Kafka stream received by Spark

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -servers SERVERS      Hostname or IP and port of Kafka broker producing
                        stream. [KAFKA_IPPORT/KAFKA_IPPORT_SIM]
  -topic TOPIC          Name of Kafka topic stream to read from.
                        [KAFKA_TOPIC/KAFKA_TOPIC_SIM]
  -schema SCHEMA        Schema to decode the alert. Should be avro file.
                        [FINK_ALERT_SCHEMA]
  -startingoffsets STARTINGOFFSETS
                        From which offset you want to start pulling data.
                        [KAFKA_STARTING_OFFSET]
  -outputpath OUTPUTPATH
                        Directory on disk for saving live data.
                        [FINK_ALERT_PATH]
  -checkpointpath CHECKPOINTPATH
                        For some output sinks where the end-to-end fault-
                        tolerance can be guaranteed, specify the location
                        where the system will write all the checkpoint
                        information. This should be a directory in an HDFS-
                        compatible fault-tolerant file system. See
                        conf/fink.conf & https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/
                        structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#starting-
                        streaming-queries [FINK_ALERT_CHECKPOINT]
  -finkwebpath FINKWEBPATH
                        Folder to store UI data for display. [FINK_UI_PATH]
  -tinterval TINTERVAL  Time interval between two monitoring. In seconds.
                        [FINK_TRIGGER_UPDATE]
  -tinterval_kafka TINTERVAL_KAFKA
                        Time interval between two messages are published. In
                        seconds. [TIME_INTERVAL]
  -exit_after EXIT_AFTER
                        Stop the service after `exit_after` seconds. This
                        primarily for use on Travis, to stop service after
                        some time. Use that with `fink start service
                        --exit_after <time>`. Default is None.
  -datapath DATAPATH    Folder containing alerts to be published by Kafka.
                        [FINK_DATA_SIM]
  -poolsize POOLSIZE    Maximum number of alerts to send. If the poolsize is
                        bigger than the number of alerts in `datapath`, then
                        we replicate the alerts. Default is 5. [POOLSIZE]
```
Note that not all of them are in used in all services (but they all share the same parser).
### Spark's verbosity is overwhelming my logs!

Yes... By default Apache Spark outputs many many things - good for debug, but awful in production. In Fink we provide a utils to deal with Spark logs in your service:

```python
# inside your service
from fink_broker.sparkUtils import quiet_logs

# Your application
# ...

# Grab the running Spark Session,
# otherwise create it.
spark = SparkSession \
    .builder \
    .appName("classifyStream") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Set logs to be quieter (Just error messages)
# Put WARN or INFO for debugging, but you will have to dive into
# a sea of millions irrelevant messages for what you typically need...
quiet_logs(spark.sparkContext, log_level="ERROR")

# The rest of your application
# ...
```

### How can I test my service before production?

You can use it with the [simulator](simulator.md). See also the section [Testing Fink](testing-fink.md).

## Configuration

### How can I use a custom configuration?

Take inspiration from `conf/fink.conf`, and link your service to your custom configuration using

```bash
fink start <service> -c /path/my/custom_conf.conf
```

we recommend to not edit directly `conf/fink.conf`, but rather edit a copy of it.

## Apache Kafka

### How do I connect to a secured Kafka cluster?

First, you need to create a file (let's call it `jaas.conf`) with your username and password (assuming PLAINTEXT):

```java
// In jaas.conf
KafkaClient {
      org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required
       username="your_user_name_or_api_key"
        password="your_pwd";
 };
```

Then in the configuration file (assuming the `jaas.conf` is in the current directory), adds:

```bash
# in conf/myconf.conf
EXTRA_SPARK_CONFIG='<your config> --files jaas.conf
--driver-java-options "-Djava.security.auth.login.config=./jaas.conf"
--conf "spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-Djava.security.auth.login.config=./jaas.conf"'
```

You will find such a file in the folder `${FINK_HOME}/conf`

## Troubleshooting

### Failed to construct kafka consumer

This usually means there is no Kafka producer running at the `KAFKA_IPPORT` you specified in your [configuration](configuration.md). Check if there is no typo.

### The simulator is publishing alerts, but I do not see anything on the service side.

Make sure you use correctly the same `KAFKA_IPPORT_SIM` and `KAFKA_TOPIC_SIM` in both sides (simulator and service).


### fink: line 91: /conf/fink.conf: No such file or directory

You forgot to set `FINK_HOME`. The best is to add the path to Fink in your `.bash_profile`:

```bash
# in ~/.bash_profile
export FINK_HOME=/path/to/fink-broker
export PYTHONPATH=$FINK_HOME/python:$PYTHONPATH
export PATH=$FINK_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
