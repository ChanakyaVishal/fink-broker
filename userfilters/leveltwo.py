def dist_stream_cut(sigmapsf: Any, sgscore1: Any) -> pd.Series:
    """ Apply user defined cuts to the distribution stream.

    The user will edit this function (or create a new filtering function)
    with his/her needs the following way:

    1) Set the input entry column (i.e. replace sigmapsf,
        sgscore1, etc. by what you need). These must be `candidate` entries.
    2) Update the logic inside the function. The idea is to
        apply conditions based on the values of the columns.
    3) Return a column whose entry is false if the alert has to be discarded,
    and true otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sigmapsf: Spark DataFrame Column
        Column containing the sigmapsf values
    sgscore1: Spark DataFrame Column
        Column containing the sgscore1 values

    Returns
    ----------
    out: pandas.Series of bool
        Return a Pandas DataFrame with the appropriate flag: false for bad alert,
        and true for good alert.

    """
    mask = sigmapsf.values < 0.1
    mask *= sgscore1.values >= 0.75

    return pd.Series(mask)
